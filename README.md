# Basic NFT Website Project

This is a basic NFT minting website, the website is INCOMPLETE and still requires href links to be added, withdraw pages, NFT wallet views and other components. 

To run this please update the .env file with the required information and use Visual Studio Code coupled with Hardhat.

Once deployed to the testnet, update the MainMint.js file with the contract address.
